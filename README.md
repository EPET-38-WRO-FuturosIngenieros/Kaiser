The autonomous robotic car is equipped to navigate a square field (3m x 3m) using a combination of sensors and motors. The Arduino UNO serves as the central controller, processing sensor inputs and managing motor outputs to guide the car's movements.

DC motors drive the car, while the L298N motor driver controls the speed and direction of these motors. Ultrasonic sensors, mounted on a servo motor, scan the environment to detect obstacles and determine the distance to objects. The data from these sensors allows the car to make decisions on whether to continue straight or turn.

A second servo motor is integrated into a complex steering system, enabling precise directional changes. The car adjusts its path based on real-time sensor data, ensuring it can navigate the field without colliding with the walls.

The carâ€™s lightweight acrylic chassis and stable wheels support smooth movement and effective maneuverability within the designated area.
